# BlogApp
Made using the MEN stack.

Users can post their own blogs with titles, images, and descriptions in normally text or HTML. For the front-end, it uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses Semantic UI. For the back-end, it uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This project demonstrates the use of RESTful routing to make routing simpler and easier to follow. Note that this is the RESTful Blog App as shown on Colt Steele's course: The Web Developer Bootcamp.
